# AlgorithmComparison
This project was completed by Brian Curlee for ITCS-6114. It is a simple demonstration of time complexity from a few selected sorting algorithms. 
Algorithm design was implemented from lecture slides and adapted for use with Python. Having said this, many of the algorithms were presented recursively. 
Some adaption was made to adjust for Python's native recursive depth limitation, by making both iterative and recursive versions of some examples.
All of the data discussed in the report are reflective of this iterative implementation. Both versions are present here for comparison.
