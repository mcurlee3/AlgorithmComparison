# AlgorithmComparison
This project was completed by Brian Curlee for ITCS-6114. It is a simple demonstration of time complexity from a few selected sorting algorithms. 
Algorithm design was implemented from lecture slides and adapted for use with Python. Having said this, many of the algorithms were presented recursively. 
Some adaption was made to adjust for Python's native recursive depth limitation, by making both iterative and recursive versions of some examples.
All of the data discussed in the report are reflective of this iterative implementation. Both versions are present here for comparison.

##Running the Code
The code for this program can either be run via Google Collab at the link below, or downloaded from this repository in the Code folder on GitHub. Test.py acts as the main module, however all algorithms for the module are found on in SortingAlgorithm.py. Both will be needed for successful implementation. The notebook is also available in the Python Notebook folder on GitHub. A written report can be found in the Report folder on GitHub.
